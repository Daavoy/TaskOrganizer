# TaskOrganizer

Project for DAT152 Advanced Web Applications.
Contains the client side of a task organizer webapplication. The project code has been written with regards to specifications given by the lecturers.
The index.html should only contain custom html tag, made by a JavaScript file, that imports JavaScript modules. Said modules are Task-List and Task-Box.
There should be no direct communication between Task-List and Task-Box, all access should be handled by a controller code, and callback functions.

The project is almost finished, but the changestatus-callback function needs further refinement.
